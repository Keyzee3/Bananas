    <p class="yellow small">Bananas Variable is a variable typefont created by Patrick Griffin, a co-founder of the type foundary Canada Type. Canada Type is located in Toronto, Canada and was founded in 2004. The studio is home to a "bunch" of fonts of all varieties and uses. Some of their other most unique and "a-peel-ing" fonts include Celebrity, Clarendon Text Pro (a remake of Clarendon), and autobats, a dingbat font made entirely of vehicles. </p>

        <p class="yellow small">While this font leans on humanist design philosophies, meaning it  and is playful, it isn’t "monkeying around". "Gibbon" its status as a variable font, its weight can be slightly adjusted to suit your needs. This makes it "ripe" for plenty of situations. This also increases its accessibility, so even your "nana" could read it. </p>
        
        <p class="yellow small">While this font is quite distinctive, there are others that "peel" like it. Hooligan JF looks quite similar to Bananas, but its hard to know who "Aped" who. You can go "bananas" for Bananas Variable by downloading it through Adobe Fonts. </p>
